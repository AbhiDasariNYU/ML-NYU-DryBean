This project is focused on exploratory data analysis of the Dry Bean Dataset, which was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of images of 13,611 grains of seven different registered varieties of dry beans, and 16 features, including 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains using a computer vision system. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the data and prepare it for further analysis, such as building a classification model.

The project begins with an overview of the dataset, including a description of the attributes and the seven classes of dry beans. The data is then loaded using the read_csv() function, and several R commands are used to examine the data, including head(), tail(), and str(). The summary() function is used to produce descriptive statistics such as minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum values of the input data. Further statistical insights are obtained by calculating the mean and standard deviation of each column in the dataset.

The project also includes an analysis of correlations among the variables, hypothesis testing, detection and handling of outliers, and variable importance. The results of the exploratory data analysis will help in the selection of appropriate models and features for further analysis, such as building a classification model to predict the class of dry beans based on the extracted features. This project demonstrates the importance of exploratory data analysis in understanding the dataset and preparing it for further analysis.
